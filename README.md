About
-----

This repository contains design documents for Common LIMS (https://github.com/commonlims/commonlims)

Currently, work on Common LIMS is managed in an internal JIRA board, but references design documents in this repository. After version 1.0 is finished, all ticket handling will be moved to github.

Note that documentation for the system should be in https://github.com/commonlims/commonlims. This repository is maintained separately as it contains WIP screenshots etc. that are not relevant for regular use of the software. 

Structure
---------

This documentation is divided into use case groups, e.g.:

    usecases/
        users-and-groups/
        samples-and-containers/
            list-samples/
        user-tasks/
            list-user-tasks/

Each of these directories includes one or more design doc, ranging from text docs to image files (using some open source format) which describe how the feature should work. If the feature is in the develop branch, it's still being discussed, if it's in master it represents the current vision of the system.
